## :wave: About Me

My name is Samuel Cho and I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for coding and striving to further develop my skillsets and knowledge of programming and software development. 

After graduating from UC Riverside with a bachelors in biology, I decided to attend the Full-Immersion Web Development Program at LearningFuze. At LearningFuze, I dedicated 10+ hours a day to learning technologies and practicing code, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React and more. I am able to apply these skills to create projects in a work-like/professional environment. I have learned JavaScript and the ability to learn new technologies efficiently and effectively. My passion for software development has continued to grow as I continue to learn everyday.

My biggest triumphs since becoming a developer is the ability to create solo web applications, from wireframing to deploying on a live demo application. My time and development during LearningFuze has taught me that I can code and create projects from the ground up. I am eager to continue to grow in my skillsets and continue to expand my knowledge in development.
